# Pandas-Challenge
The PyCitySchools code reads the school and student csv files and merges both of them into one dataframe.
The schools csv file contains School ID, school name, type, size and budget, while the students csv file Student IDs, student names, gender, grade, school name, reading and math scores. For the data analysis, we manipulated the merged dataframe into different, smaller dataframes based on different parameters (sorted by school size, school name, spending and school type.
Based on the dataframes created by the code, we can see that out of the 39,170 students in 15 different schools, students tend to pass reading tests more often versus  students passing math tests  (85% and 74% respectively). The average reading and math scores also follow a similar trend, with average reading scores (81%) being higher than average math scores (78%).
We can also see that charter schools have better average scores (83 for math and 83 for reading) and an overall passing percentage of 90%. While district schools had slightly lower average scores (76 for math and 80 for reading) and a significantly lower pass percentage of 53%.
With spending ranges per student as the criteria for comparing scores, the notable difference was when the spending range changed from $590-$620 to $620-$645, with a 24% decrease in overall passing scores when the spending per student was on the higher ranges. A similar trend can be seen when looking at the grouped data for school size, with the lower overall passing percentage being on the larger schools (2000-5000 students), versus the schools that have less than 2000 students.
